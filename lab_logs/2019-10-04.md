Done today:
x properly aligned the interferometer using V1 3D prints, managed to get a circular interference pattern
x tried to get first signal using setup V1, we were able to see clear peaks when an interference front crossed the light detector
x made plans for next week:

	Hardware:

	SAMPLE FOR INTERFEROMETER
	Sample holder 3D model:
	x 20x*20y*##z sample 
	x maybe allow use of screw as test sample? ( to test the idea and calibrate )

	Sample heating and sensing:
	x preferably get 2 temp sensors
	x a heating element if possible? ( we can also heat it up in hot water and see it shrink )

	SETUP V2
	2020 ClipOn changes:
	x height changes of ClipOns for optical elements ( check heights again before printing )
		- LD 3mm  above 2020
		- LS 6mm  above 2020
		- L  8mm  above 2020
		- M  10mm above 2020
	x make system to fix the ClipOns to 2020 extrusion
		- M4 bolt and nut 
		OR
		- barb/hook to clip onto 2020 extrusion ( is PLA flexible enough?? )


	Software:

	x Debug interface (arduino to python)
	x Study the data we get to better understand how to analyse/filter it
	x Find a way to filter the data --> do it in python with raw data VS do it on arduino for clean signal??
	x See if we can write a script to time-stamp the change in interference rings to make data analysis better?


	Misc:

	x teach Hayley to do 3D modelling
	x teach Hugo how to git properly
	x make proper documentation
	x create logbook
	x prep mentor meeting (wednesday)
	x prep meeting with Sanli
