done on wednesday:
x made 2nd version of 3D models for interferometer frame and started the print

done on thursday:
x collected and cleaned up the 3D prints
x fitted the optical equipment onto the 3D printed frame
x started calibration

to do on friday:
1 properly align the interferometer WE DID IT!
2 see if we can get a first signal? WE DID IT!
3 revise model V2 to see if any changes need to be made

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
items from V1 to V2

x BS midpoint is 30mm above frame
x laser diode, light sensor and mirrors are 29mm above frame
--> possible solution 1 add flushers of 1mm to the 29mm parts to bring them to 30mm
-->                   2 revise frame clip-on bits to be 1mm higher (faster print than new middle piece)

x lens midpoint is 27mm above frame
x rest is 30mm/29mm above frame (LD,LS,M1 & M2)
--> possible solution 1 revise frame clip-on specifically for lenses to add 3mm and make it at 30mm height
