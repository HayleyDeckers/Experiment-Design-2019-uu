Got the print from the machine. Looks okay. The alluminium extrusions don't quite fit but they should be fine after some hot-tooling on monday.
Connected the arduino to the photosensor and my laptop. Somewhat works? the serial interface seems to spit out some noise from time to time, and doesn't produce sensible values when dumping binary data. Probably a logic error, I'll look into it some more on monday. -Hayley
