Doing science is expensive. Doing science is hard. Or so is probably the general expectation.

The instruments from which you build up your experiment must be of great quality and must be crafted to a great precision to make your experiment work! Right? This means that it must be really hard to design and make your own experiment! Right?

We are here to tell you otherwise. We custom designed the parts we needed, and we had them made using a 3D printer. The rest of the experiment was made using parts you can easily acquire yourself. With all this we created our own Michelson Interferometer, an instrument that can measure lengths on the nanometer scale!

Now with the availability of 3D printers nowadays you could even do this at home! Do you want to see how? Come and join us during the poster presentation and find out!
