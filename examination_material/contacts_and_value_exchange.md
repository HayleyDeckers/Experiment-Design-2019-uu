## state of value-exchange and the ideal state

Most of our value exchange with the UU-staff has been one-directional, where we receive assistance from the staff without providing a service to them. This is to be expected, but obviously not ideal. With the students we have had a more equal exchange pattern. When someone, either us to the other students or other students towards us, has a problem the experience has been that everyone will try their best to help within constraints of their knowledge and available time.
