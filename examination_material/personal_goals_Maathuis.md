# Name: H Maathuis

## Personal goals:
* learn how to physically design, set-up and perform an experiment from scratch
* I would like to learn more about how to set up and use optics, as I have often read about experiments using applied optics but never had a chance to set one up myself
* I would like to learn how to properly use git to document the process/progress of our experiments

I have quite some experience with “hands-on” lab work, problem-solving in the lab and prototyping (from my 3D printing hobby), but I have never set up an experiment from scratch. It was always an existing setup that I worked on or improved upon. So, to go from the drawing board to the finished experiment will be a great learning experience for me. I know how to program and how to do statistical data analysis, but how to fully incorporate that into one thing and use git properly is something I have very little experience with and something I certainly would want to learn.

## Mid-Course review of goals:
* we have definitely made progress in our own setup, and are still working through (un)-expected issues. Since the setup is was an existing interferometer scheme (with our own added flair) I feel less like I learned to design, but definitely am learning how to set up and perform the experiment.
* This was way less exciting than expected, as the optics parts do what we expect them to do. I did learn some tips and tricks on alignment and calibration from Dorian, our mentor, in our last meeting.
* I am doing this right now, writing my mid-course evaluation on Atom, a program that is handy to use with GitHub that Hayley has introduced me to.

## Final review of goals:
* In the end of the course I think I can say I definitely learned a few things on what items to think of when designing an experiment. Our main issues were with perfectly aligning the setup, where we were able to align it but not keep it so while making a measurement. Next time I will definitely try to keep rigidity and alignment better in mind with the design stage.
* The optics we used were not very complicated, but I have definitely learned a lot of practical tips and tricks to align a setup quicker and more reliably. This practical skill is useful when making new projects and is something I am quite happy with acquiring.
* I feel like I have a solid grasp of how to use Git for project documentation now. We used mdbook to make our experiment's manual, which I found very nice to use as well. I might not have been able to use the finer features of Git in version control and such, but I think a basis of how to Git has certainly be acquired.

### Possible course improvements:
It would have been nice if the project was smeared over a longer time, as that gives some time to think over what is happening. Not necessarily more time to work on the project, but more time to have an idea settle and flourish.
