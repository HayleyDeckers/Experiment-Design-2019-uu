Name: H Maathuis

Personal goals:
-> learn how to physically design, set-up and perform an experiment from scratch
-> I would like to learn more about how to set up and use optics, as I have often read about experiments using applied optics but never had a chance to set one up myself
-> I would like to learn how to properly use git to document the process/progress of our experiments

I have quite some experience with “hands-on” lab work, problem-solving in the lab and prototyping (from my 3D printing hobby), but I have never set up an experiment from scratch. It was always an existing setup that I worked on or improved upon. So, to go from the drawing board to the finished experiment will be a great learning experience for me. I know how to program and how to do statistical data analysis, but how to fully incorporate that into one thing and use git properly is something I have very little experience with and something I certainly would want to learn.

Mid-Course review of goals:
-> we have definitely made progress in our own setup, and are still working through (un)-expected issues. Since the setup is was an existing interferometer scheme (with our own added flair) I feel less like I learned to design, but definitely am learning how to set up and perform the experiment.
-> This as way less exciting than expected, as the optics parts do what we expect them to do. I did learn some tips and tricks on alignment and calibration from Dorian, our mentor, in our last meeting.
-> I am doing this right now, writing my mid-course evaluation on Atom, a program that is handy to use with GitHub that Hayley has introduced me to.
