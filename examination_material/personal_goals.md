## Personal goals
Fill here what you expect to learn in this course personally and define your personal goals
* How to design, set-up, perform, and document an experiment from start to finish
* I want to learn about various experimental techniques and equipment used to test the theories we studied before.
* I would like to learn more about applied optics as I do not know much about it yet, but it seems widely applicable and useful.

My personal goals would be to meet the above, and I would like to obtain more hands-on lab experience and learn how to approach a 'physical' project and possibly how to
do literature research. As I already have quite a lot of experience with programming, git, handling of data etc. but I have had very little experience with "hands-on" experiments.

## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
Note what skills you have learned so far, whether you are hitting your own targets and if you need to modify them. State if the course structure allows you to attain your goals.
* Learned a lot about engineering considerations, esp. in regards to working with a 3d-printer such as the impact of nozzle-size, orientation of the to-be-printed object w.r.t. the print bed
* Basics of constructing and debugging an optical systems
* (re-)learned Arduino and electronical interfacing 
* learning how to document experiments

I haven't learned :
 * literature review

## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
Review the course from your personal point of view and whether it met your expectations. State how you could have done better and suggest changes that can make the course better.
