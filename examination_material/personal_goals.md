## Personal goals
Fill here what you expect to learn in this course personally and define your personal goals
* How to design, set-up, perform, and document an experiment from start to finish
* I want to learn about various experimental techniques and equipment used to test the theories we studied before.
* I would like to learn more about applied optics as I do not know much about it yet, but it seems widely applicable and useful.

My personal goals would be to meet the above, and I would like to obtain more hands-on lab experience and learn how to approach a 'physical' project and possibly how to
do literature research. As I already have quite a lot of experience with programming, git, handling of data etc. but I have had very little experience with "hands-on" experiments.

## Mid-course review of goals (fill this mid-course)
Note what skills you have learned so far, whether you are hitting your own targets and if you need to modify them. State if the course structure allows you to attain your goals.
* Learned a lot about engineering considerations, esp. in regards to working with a 3d-printer such as the impact of nozzle-size, orientation of the to-be-printed object w.r.t. the print bed
* Basics of constructing and debugging an optical systems
* (re-)learned Arduino and electronical interfacing
* learning how to document experiments

I haven't learned :
 * literature review

## Final review of goals (fill at the end of the course)
Review the course from your personal point of view and whether it met your expectations. State how you could have done better and suggest changes that can make the course better.

 I am kind of dissapointed that we were not able to get our experiment to work in time. Especially because I think we got very close. However, I do feel I have learned *"How to design, set-up, perform, and document an experiment from start to finish"* and got some hands on experience working with optical elements. I have actually ordered some electrical parts and I am planning to do some at home experiments and projects in part as a result of this project.

 If I could do the experiment over, I think we should have sticked to our original idea and used the optical table/university set-up for all but the sample holder. Not because I think it would be neccesary from an accuracy stand-point, but because we had limited time to perform the experiment and a large part of our time ended being spend on interacting over the design.

 We could also have done a bit better in regards to our bookkeeping. We should have started keeping track and using git from the start. However, me and Hugo see each other a lot outside of class, so a lot of our communication occured through other channels. This did make the git/lab log/bookkeeping feel less neccesary (although I do believe it is a good practice, especially in larger projects it just didn't feel *as* important in this specific case. As if we'd be doing it purely for practice instead of neccesity).

In terms of the course structure itself, I think it would have been helpful to start on the experiment itself sooner. Perhaps space out the initial lectures some more. This would make it less stressful and give better opportunity to deal with any unforseen issues. A more structured approach would also be helpful. While I appreciate the free-form nature of the course and could be a bit confusing at times. For example in terms of what was expected of us, and where we could find various bits of information. I'd also reduce the amount of software used. I feel like we didn't end up using any of the software to its full-potential as a result of things being spread out so much. I'd rather see the course focus more on using Gitlab and project management and leaving out Onedrive for example. Other then that I enjoyed the course and think that it's good that it's part of the curriculum.
