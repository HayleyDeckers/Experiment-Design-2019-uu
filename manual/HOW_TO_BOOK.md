This file is for contributors and not part of the book.

This documentation is written in mdBook. The manual of which can be found [here](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/index.html).

A very short how-to would be:
 * [install mdbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/cli/index.html)
 * run `mdbook --watch -o` from here
 * Add any chapters you wish to add in `src/SUMMARY.md`
 * write!
 * commit any chapters you've written! (n.b. don't commit empty files!)

All chapters are written in Markdown (like this file).  

see also [the source of the rust book](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/book/master/src/SUMMARY.md) for a good example.
