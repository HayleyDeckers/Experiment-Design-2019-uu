Drs. D. Killian, Technical Support Assistant for Teaching and Research UU, who organized and delivered 3 samples for the experiment (brass, steel and aluminium rods), introduced us to the laser cutter and Formlabs 3D-printer if we need it, sourced the AD590 temperature sensor and assisted in a range of practical issues during the project.

R.H.S. Borkus, Research and Education Assistant, who assisted with a range of practical issues in the laboratory, supplied optical elements used in the experiment and supplied tools needed to construct the experiment.

P. Koopman, Technical Support Assistant for Teaching and Research, who assisted in alignment of the optical elements of the experiment, in organizing the breadboard and Arduino electronics and soldered jumper wires for AD590 temperature sensor for us.

Dr. D.F. Bouchet, Researcher (and our project's mentor), who advised in alignment of the setup, advised during design of the setup and advised on the data analysis of the signal.

## Thanks to our fellow students

Whom helped when we needed assistance and were wonderful to bounce ideas with when trying to solve issues. We hope we have been of assistance to you too.

Special thanks to the teams of Rinske & Sam and Amber & Stan, with whom we worked together quite closely and often.

## Thanks to our friends

A big thank you to our (lay) friends who offered their time to be a guinea pig in testing if our manual and instructions were remotely clear.
