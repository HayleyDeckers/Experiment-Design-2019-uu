# Safety Instructions

If using the same parts as us, there is little personal risk while working with equipment. But, as always, be careful around lasers even weaker ones. Do not place the laser at eye-level and always be aware of your surroundings. When connecting the electronics to the Arduino always double check your circuits before turning on the power, an incorrect circuit could over-volt and destroy the Arduino. Also be careful when attaching the 3d printed parts to the alluminium frame. Putting too much force on the screws can crack the plastic.
