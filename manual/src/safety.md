# Safety Instructions

If using the same parts as us, there is little personal risk while working with equipment.

However, as always, be careful around lasers even weaker ones. The laser used in our experiment is a laser diode of [safety class 3R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_safety#Class_3R). Do not place the laser at eye-level and always be aware of your surroundings.

When connecting the electronics to the Arduino always double check your circuits before turning on the power, an incorrect circuit could input a voltage that is too high for the Arduino to handle and destroy the Arduino. If this should happen, try to inhale as little of the fumes as possible as they are noxious.

Also be careful when attaching the 3d printed parts to the aluminium frame. Putting too much force on the bolts can crack the polymer. Do not heat the polymer parts (or metal parts attached to them) over 60 degrees Celcius, as they will enter glass-liquid transition states and deform.
