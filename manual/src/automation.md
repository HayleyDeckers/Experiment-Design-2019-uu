# Automating detection

In principle, one could now measure the thermal expansion of a sample manually. Simply record the temperature over time of the sample and visually count how many fringe shifts you see. However, [laziness is the mother of invention](https://simple.wikiquote.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie) and so we would rather automate the experiment to the best of our ability.

  In the next sections we will show how to set-up an Arduino to this end, and how to interface it with a PC for data processing and how to use this set-up for collecting data.
