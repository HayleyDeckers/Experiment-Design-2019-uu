# Attaching the gain detector

Now in order to measure a digital signal we need to use a digital detector to measure the intensity of the interference pattern at a given spot. The detector can simply be mounted onto the last free arm. We recommend putting an aperture in front of the sensor to limit the viewing area of the sensor.

Now your setup should be fully done and resemble the design in [chapter 4](./build_start.md).
