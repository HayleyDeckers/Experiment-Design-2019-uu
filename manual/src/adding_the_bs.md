# adding the beamsplitter

Next we add the beamsplitter in the center of the frame. This is a relatively simple part, but it is also crucial it is aligned properly. Screw it into the center of the frame and pay attention to the markings on top.  

If aligned properly, the mirror-laser pair we just set-up should remain aligned and the split off beam should be at the exact same place as the one hitting the opposite mirror. You can check this with a piece of paper or a target disc.
