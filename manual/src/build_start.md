# Our interferometer design

In the final design of this experiment very little was changed from the simple [schematic of the Michelson Interferometer](./M_interferometer.md) discussed in the previous chapter. In this chapter the design is shortly discussed before moving on to actually building the setup using the materials we had available in the next chapters. The design is shown in the figure below and should be sufficient to use as a guide if you want to build your own physical setup. If this is the case do not hesitate to skip the next chapter [about our parts](./needed_materials.md) and move to the chapter about [aligning the optics](./optics.md).

Changes in the design are two-fold:
- we added a sample holder to one of the mirrors which is used to measure the thermal expansion
- we added a lens to expand the laser beam.

The reason for adding the sample holder is obvious, without it we cannot perform the experiment we want to perform. The expansion of the laser beam is done to increase the area of the interference pattern on the light sensor. This makes distinguishing between light and dark fringes easier. Both of these additions will be discussed in more detail in later chapters.

*The design of our interferometer. Note that the biggest difference to the [schematic of the Michelson Interferometer](./M_interferometer.md) in the previous chapter is that we have placed a lens close to the laser diode which expands the beam. This is done to make the interference pattern larger at the screen or light sensor.*
