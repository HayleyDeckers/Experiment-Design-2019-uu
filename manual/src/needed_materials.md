# What do you need?

 In order to build a simple Michelson interferometer, at a bare minimum you need:
  * a coherent light-source (a laser)
  * two adjustable mirrors
  * a beam splitter

It is also useful to have the following:
 * A lens to increase the size of the laser beam, so that the interference pattern becomes more visible.
 * A target plate to help align the laser. A marked piece of white paper will also work in a pinch.

All our optical parts came from [Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com/), as these were made  available to us via the university, but other suppliers are available. Or one can try their [luck extracting parts from old cd/dvd drives](https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/2610/building-laser-interferometer-from-cd-dvd-drives-parts). (n.b. the lasers used in CD/DVD drives are class 3! so be careful!)

One also needs some way of attaching all the parts together, for this we designed our own construction made from alluminium extrusions and 3d-printed parts.
In the next section we will show you how to build our set-up.
