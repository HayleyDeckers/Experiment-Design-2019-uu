# Foreword

This is a manual documenting a DIY-Michelson Interferometer that was constructed for a university course and the manual has a two-fold aim. Firstly this manual was created to allow our fellow students to try and reproduce our work as a requirement for the course. Secondly, and more importantly: You might be someone who stumbled upon this project when browsing the web. If so: enjoy the read and hopefully this inspires you to try re-creating this project yourself or starting a similar project on your own!

If you are one of our fellow students: you might want to put two of the metal sample rods (wrapped in a plastic bag) in the freezer in room 0.03 when you start reading this manual.
