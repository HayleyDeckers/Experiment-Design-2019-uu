# Getting a good interference pattern

 In order to get a good interference pattern once the beams are almost aligned we recommend the following steps:

 0. only ever move one of the mirrors at a time. Note that this system is very sensitive to vibrations and therefore handle it gently and try not to lean on whatever surface it is on. When adjusting the mirrors let go of the screws occasionally to see how the pattern shifts. It is very easy to shift or disrupt the pattern simply by holding onto the screws. Remember, we are talking about nano-meter scale disturbances.
 1. Align the laser dots by eye. most of the time there will be some artifacts on the expanded laser beam (for example from a speck of dust). These can make great reference points for aligning the beams to.
 2. tweak the screws until you start seeing any interference pattern. Be it circles or lines.
 3. Try and get the central dot of the interference pattern centered on your target. If you only see lines you are far away for the dot. If you see horizontal lines you will have to move on the vertical axis and vice versa. As you get closer to the central dot the frequency of the lines should decrease, you can use this feature to determine if you should move up or down.

 If you follow these steps, you should be able to get a big and clear circular interference pattern.
