# laser and opposite mirror

## laser
 Start by attaching the laser to one of the sliders. Place it opposite of the sample holder.  Try and get it level using the screws and manual adjustments to the laser position. You can check if it's level by holding a piece of paper in the path of the laser and seeing if it moves as you move the paper further away.

## opposite mirror

Next, attach the mirror opposite of the laser. Attach the mirror as straight as possible, and use the micro-screws to make some small adjustments. When aligned properly it should reflect the laser-light right back into the laser itself. (as this is not very good for the laser, we recommend placing an aperture in front of the laser).
