# Measuring thermal expansion
Now that we have a working Michelson interferometer with sample holder, and a method of recording our data, it is time to put it to use.  As explained before, we wish to measure the thermal expansion of a sample. And we can do this by counting the shift in fringes as it expands or contracts as a result of its changing temperature.

There are two ways of changing the temperature of the sample. Either we let it heat up above room temperature, or we let cool it down below room temperature. We found that directly heating the sample makes it very difficult to keep the interferometer aligned. Probably in part due to most methods heating up the surroundings too and because the plastic construct will be more prone to deformation once it gets heated.

Therefore, we highly recommend going with the second approach: and starting with a sample that is cooled below room temperature. The easiest way to do this is to put it in a plastic bag (as to prevent condensation) and put that bag in the freezer for a little while. Then quickly place the now frozen sample back into the holder, align the system once more, and run the measurement script.  If working in a group, we advise you to either wear gloves or have the person with the coldest hands handle the sample once it is removed from the freezer.

Our experience has been that it is possible to collect data with this technique, however, often the central interference spot will have a tendency to move as the sample heats up. If this happens one should realign the set-up and try again. Personally, we have been unable to get it lined up properly in time yet, but we still feel as if it should be possible. We expect that the shifting occurs due to the sample mirror not being aligned correctly as that would cause the location on the screen to shift as the sample expands.

GOOD LUCK!
